<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome!</p>
<p>I'm Lin. I'm currently learning programming with a focus on Python and web development. I'm exploring front-end technologies, building small projects, and slowly working my way into the world of full-stack development.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in how code can be used to create clean, user-focused experiences. I enjoy learning new tools, solving problems, and building things from the ground up.</p>
<p>This website is where I share what I’m learning, projects I’m building, and the journey I’m on as I grow in this exciting field.</p>

    <h1>The Best Movies According to Lin</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>1. Her (2013)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A quiet masterpiece about loneliness, love, and the fragility of human connection.</li>
        <li>Why I love it: It's poetic, slow, aching—like the kind of love you carry even after it’s gone.</li>
        <li>You’ll love it if: You're a romantic dreamer who sometimes feels a little too much.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Interstellar (2014)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A sci-fi odyssey that bends time and space—but at its heart, it's about a father’s love and human resilience.</li>
        <li>Why I love it: Because it reminds me of how far I'd travel for you, even through wormholes and lifetimes.</li>
        <li>You’ll love it if: You crave epic emotion with your stardust and science.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Call Me by Your Name (2017)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A slow-burn summer romance in the Italian countryside. Tender, heart-wrenching, and unforgettable.</li>
        <li>Why I love it: The silences, the stolen glances, the peach… and the pain of a love that couldn’t stay.</li>
        <li>You’ll love it if: You believe some loves are meant to shape us—even if they don’t last.</li>
    </ul>
